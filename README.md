# Bookmarks Web App (Angular 1, Twitter Bootstrap)
This is a basic web app that is a bookmarking appllication for saving website addresses. 

It is made with Angular.js app that uses Twitter Bootstrap.

This app was hugely inspired by the video tutorial series on egghead.io by Lukas Rebleke.
Thanks Lukas, and I definitely reccommend the videos.
