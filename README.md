# Bookmarks Web App (Angular 1, Twitter Bootstrap)
This is a basic web app that is a bookmarking appllication for saving website addresses. 

It is made with Angular.js app that uses Twitter Bootstrap.

I wrote this code while watching the video tutorial series on egghead.io, *[AngularJS Fundamentals] https://egghead.io/series/angularjs-app-from-scratch-getting-started by Lukas Rebleke.
Thanks Lukas, and I definitely reccommend the videos.

This is a fantastic *intro* example of AngularJS for someone *just beginning*. I say that because it's a super small app, uses only a single controller, and makes heavy use of $scope (a big no-no most of the time). 

However, this code works and really shows the bare bones of Angular in action to a green Angular dev.
